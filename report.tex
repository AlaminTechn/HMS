% Abstract
\newpage
\begin{abstract}
This thesis presents a comprehensive Software Requirements Specification (SRS) and full project documentation for a Hospital Management System (HMS) designed specifically for the Bangladeshi healthcare context. The system aims to digitize and streamline hospital operations, enhance patient care, and improve administrative efficiency in alignment with international standards while addressing local healthcare challenges.

The HMS incorporates advanced features for patient management, appointment scheduling, medical records, billing, pharmacy, laboratory services, and reporting. Drawing inspiration from leading Bangladeshi hospitals such as Ibn Sina, Labaid, Square Hospitals, and BIRDEM, the system is engineered to handle the complexities of modern healthcare delivery in Bangladesh.

The document covers the complete software development lifecycle, including system analysis, design, implementation, testing, and evaluation. It includes detailed UML diagrams, data flow diagrams, entity-relationship models, and a comprehensive database design. The system architecture employs modern web technologies with robust security measures to ensure data privacy and system reliability.

This work demonstrates how technology can transform healthcare delivery in developing countries like Bangladesh, providing a scalable solution that can be adapted to various hospital sizes and specialties. The implementation includes role-based access control, real-time reporting, and integration capabilities with existing healthcare infrastructure.

The findings indicate that the proposed HMS can significantly reduce administrative overhead, minimize errors in patient records, and improve overall healthcare service quality. The system is designed to be user-friendly, scalable, and compliant with healthcare data privacy regulations, making it suitable for deployment in Bangladeshi hospitals of varying scales.

\section{Background}
Healthcare systems worldwide are undergoing rapid digitization to improve efficiency, reduce errors, and enhance patient outcomes. In Bangladesh, where the healthcare sector is growing rapidly, there is a pressing need for comprehensive Hospital Management Systems (HMS) that can handle the unique challenges of the local healthcare environment.

\section{Problem Statement}
Traditional paper-based hospital management systems in Bangladesh face numerous challenges including:
\begin{itemize}
\item Manual record-keeping leading to data loss and errors
\item Inefficient appointment scheduling and resource allocation
\item Delayed billing and payment processes
\item Lack of real-time data for decision-making
\item Difficulty in tracking patient medical history
\item Inadequate inventory management for medicines and supplies
\end{itemize}

\section{Project Objectives}
The primary objectives of this project are:
\begin{enumerate}
\item To design and develop a comprehensive HMS tailored for Bangladeshi healthcare facilities
\item To automate administrative processes and reduce manual workload
\item To ensure secure and efficient management of patient data
\item To provide real-time reporting and analytics for better decision-making
\item To implement role-based access control for data security
\item To create a scalable system that can adapt to hospitals of different sizes
\end{enumerate}

\section{Bangladesh Healthcare Context}
Bangladesh's healthcare sector has witnessed significant growth in recent years. The country has several world-class hospitals that serve as benchmarks for healthcare excellence:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Ibn Sina Hospital:} A multi-specialty hospital offering comprehensive services including cardiology, oncology, and emergency care. Known for its patient-centric approach and modern facilities.

\item \textbf{Labaid Specialized Hospital:} Renowned for cardiac care and cancer treatment, this hospital represents the pinnacle of specialized healthcare in Bangladesh.

\item \textbf{Square Hospitals Ltd.:} One of the largest private healthcare providers, offering a wide range of medical services with state-of-the-art technology and skilled medical professionals.

\item \textbf{Bangladesh Institute of Research and Rehabilitation in Diabetes, Endocrine and Metabolic Disorders (BIRDEM):} A specialized institute focusing on diabetes management, providing comprehensive care for diabetic patients across Bangladesh.
\end{itemize}

These institutions demonstrate the potential for advanced healthcare delivery in Bangladesh and provide valuable insights for developing a modern HMS that can serve both urban and rural healthcare facilities.

% Normalization Section
\section{Normalization}
The database design follows normalization principles to eliminate data redundancy and ensure data integrity.

\subsection{First Normal Form (1NF)}
All tables contain only atomic values with no repeating groups:
\begin{itemize}
\item Each column contains only single values
\item Each row is unique with a primary key
\item No duplicate columns within a single table
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Second Normal Form (2NF)}
All tables are in 1NF and all non-key attributes are fully dependent on the primary key:
\begin{itemize}
\item Patient details depend entirely on patient\_id
\item Appointment details depend on appointment\_id
\item No partial dependencies exist
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Third Normal Form (3NF)}
All tables are in 2NF and contain no transitive dependencies:
\begin{itemize}
\item Doctor specialization stored in Doctor table, not repeated
\item Medicine prices stored in Medicine table only
\item Room types stored with room\_id as reference
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Normalized Tables}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{User} - Contains user authentication data only
\item \textbf{Patient} - Contains patient personal and medical data
\item \textbf{Doctor} - Contains doctor professional information
\item \textbf{Appointment} - Links patients with doctors for scheduled visits
\item \textbf{Prescription} - Links to patient, doctor, and medicines
\item \textbf{Medicine} - Contains medicine inventory details
\item \textbf{Bill} - Contains billing information linked to patient
\item \textbf{LabTest} - Contains test results linked to patient
\item \textbf{Room} - Contains ward/room information
\end{enumerate}

% HIPO Section
\section{Hierarchical Input Process Output (HIPO)}
The HIPO (Hierarchical Input Process Output) model is a systems analysis design aid and documentation technique used for representing the modules of a system as a hierarchy and for documenting each module's input-process-output relationships.
